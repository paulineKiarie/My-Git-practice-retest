    "### INTRODUCTION\n",
    "The airline industry is highly competitive, and customer satisfaction plays a crucial role in determining the success and reputation of airlines. In today's digital age, social media platforms have become a significant avenue for customers to express their opinions and experiences with airlines. This project aims to develop a comprehensive solution for monitoring, analyzing, and understanding customer sentiment expressed on Twitter regarding various airlines. The project focuses on leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. By analyzing sentiment, airlines can gain actionable insights to enhance customer satisfaction, identify operational improvements, and effectively manage their brand reputation on Twitter."

    "### METHODOLOGY\n",
    "The project will follow a structured methodology encompassing the following steps:\n",
    "* Data Collection: The data was sourced from [here](https://data.world/socialmediadata/twitter-us-airline-sentiment). It was scraped from February 2015 and contains tweet reviews of different US airline companies.\n",
    "* Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the tweet data by removing noise, irrelevant information, and performing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and removing stopwords.\n",
    "* Sentiment Classification Model: Train a machine learning model (such as a supervised classifier or deep learning model) using the preprocessed dataset to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.\n",
    "* Real-time Monitoring System: Implement a system that retrieves live tweets related to airlines and applies the sentiment classification model to categorize them in real time. Handle high volume and velocity of incoming tweets efficiently and ensure scalability.\n",
    "* Insights and Recommendations: Analyze sentiment analysis results to generate actionable insights and recommendations for improving customer satisfaction, addressing pain points, and managing brand reputation effectively.\n",
    "* Response and Engagement Strategy: Develop a strategy for airlines to respond to negative sentiment and engage with customers in a timely and personalized manner. Implement systems and processes to manage customer feedback, complaints, and turnaround negative experiences into positive ones."

    "### PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "The airline industry is currently facing a notable decrease in customer satisfaction, leading to unfavorable brand perception and diminished customer loyalty. This decline in satisfaction can be attributed to several factors, including flight delays, inadequate customer service, mishandling of luggage, and other operational inefficiencies. As a result, addressing these customer concerns and enhancing the overall brand perception has become a crucial focus for airlines."

    "### SUCCESS METRICS\n",
    "\n",
    "After modeling, the success metrics for the sentiment analysis on this project includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accuracy: Measure the accuracy of the sentiment classification model in correctly categorizing tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This metric indicates the model's ability to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Precision, Recall, and F1 Score: Calculate precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's performance in correctly identifying positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to balance precision (correctly identifying positive/negative sentiments) and recall (identifying all positive/negative sentiments)."
